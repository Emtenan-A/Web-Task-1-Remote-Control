### First task for the web department is to make a remote control for the robot

In this task, a remote control was designed and programmed for the movement of the robot using HTML. The remote consists of 5 buttons: forward, backward, left, right, and stop. When pressing a button, the value is stored in the (my SQL) database, and then the value appears on a web page using PHP code.
